## **Introduction** ##

The Tipsy Mac Staggers website was created and built by Stephen Mc Govern. The aim of the website is to act as a drinks data base where users can search for a new drink/cocktail. The site will provide all of the ingredients, quantaties and instructions to make each drink.

Registered users will also be able to upload their own drinks recepies that they have made so other users can sample another users twist on an established classic drink.

## **1. User Experience (UX)** ##

### **1.1 - Target Audience** ###

* This website is aimed at anyone who is looking for instructions on how to make a cocktail/drink that they may not be familiar with or are unsure about what ingredients, quantaties and steps to follow to make that drink. The site is built around user engagement and all users are encouraged to register and add their favourite drinks to the site. 

### **1.2 - Visitor goals** ###

### **1.3 - User Stories** ###

**As a visitor to Tipsy mac Staggers i want/expect/need:**

* A simple user friendly site where i can get information of different types of cocktails/drinks that i am looking to try. I want the layout of the site to be simple and to make sense so I am not confused or put off using it.
* I want the information I am presented with to be laid out in a way that is easy for me to navigate.
* I may be viewing the site from a mobile phone or tablet. I want the site to have been designed responsively so that it is still easy to navigate and use on my mobile device.
* I also expect to be able to connect to the sites social media channels with a simple click so i can keep up to date with anything that the site admins may post there. 
* Finally as a user I expect feedback from the website I am using when I interact with it. If i send a message to the website i would like a confirmation that my message has been sent successfully. 

### **User Experience Walk through** ### 

### **1.4 - Design Choices** ###

* As the website is a site used for drink recepies I wanted it to be bright, simple to use and have a fun looking font. 

**FONTS**

* For the website i decided to use the google font style of Nixie One. This font is a mixture of neon tubes signage and a typewriter and it is a font that sits well with the colour scheme i went with. The link to the Nixie One font on Google Font can be found by clicking: [Here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nixie+One?query=nix#standard-styles)

**ICONS**

* I also decided to incorporate some icons throughout the website. I did this because icons give a more visually pleasing experience for the user and also create a more intuative user experience. For the social media icons i used (Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) All the social media icons are located in the footer of the page.

* Some of the icons on the site were taken from the Font Awesome website. The link to the Font Awesome website can be found by clicking: [Here](https://fontawesome.com/)

* The other icons i used were direct from Materialize. They can be viewed by clicking [Here](https://materializecss.com/icons.html)

**COLOURS**

* I used the website Coolors when deciding on which colours to use. This free website uses a generator to run through different colours and palletts that will match and compliment each other. The website can be found by clicking this link: [Click Here](https://coolors.co/)

* For the base colours i decided to go with the following colour palette:

<!-- ![Image of the primary colour pallet used for the project](assets/readme-images/primary-colours.png) -->

### **1.5 - Wire Frames** ###

### **2.1 - The Navbar** ###

For the Navbar i decided to use a Materialize mobile collapse navbar. I chose this option because i wanted the Navbar to be responsive on all screen sizes and the Materialize mobile collapse navbar offers this function. 

<!-- ![Image of Navbar](assets/readme-images/navbar.png) -->

The Navbar on each page is standardized, the page name "Tipsy Mac Stagger's" is located on the left hand side of the navbar. On the right hand side there are `<a>` tags that link to different pages. A registered and logged in user will see different buttons/options than an unregistered user. For an unregistered user the buttons/options they will see are:   

1. Home
2. Register
3. Log In

For an registered user the buttons/options they will see are:   

1. Home
2. Profile
3. Add Drink
4. Log Out

On smaller screen sizes the navbar will collapse, the name "Tipsy Mac Staggers" will relocate to the middle of the navbar and the buttons/options will collapse into a hamburger menu on the right that when clicked will expand and reveal the nav bar bottons/options.

<!-- ![Image of Navbar as hamburger menu](assets/readme-images/hamburger-navbar.png) -->

### **2.7 - Contact Us Form** ###

The contact us form has Email JS operating on the backend. Once a user clicks ont he send message button an alert will populate to show the user the message was sent. Email JS will also send an auto reply to the user to let them know their message was successfully received and that we will be back in contact with them.

I have also created a caps lock notification for the email input so the user will get a pop up alert if they have caps lock on when they try and enter their email address. 

<!-- ![Image of contact us form](assets/readme-images/contact-us-form.png) -->

### **2.8 - The Footer** ###

In the footer i have listed all of the companies social media links. As with the navbar, the footer is identical on each page to maintain consistency no matter what page the user finds themselves on.
